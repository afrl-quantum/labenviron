Welcome to LabEnviron's documentation!
======================================
This is a small webapp to record and display environmental measurements made
from the Adafruit development board for the BME280 sensor chip.  The interface
is expected to be made on a Raspberry Pi, but may be made to work using other
hardware.
See :ref:`Quick Start <quickstart>` for a brief synopsis for recording and
presenting data via this webapp.
