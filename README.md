LabEnviron
======================================
This is a small webapp to record and display environmental measurements made
from the Adafruit development board for the BME280 sensor chip.  The interface
is expected to be made on a Raspberry Pi, but may be made to work using other
hardware.

See the included Sphinx documentation for more information.
